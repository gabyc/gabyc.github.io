Since her first campus visit to the school, she is fascinated with all the opportunities the school offers. She takes advantages of the liberal arts curriculum and hopes to make positive differences in her profession in the future.

	<h2>An Arts Lover</h2>
	<div class="arts">
		<img src="./stylesheets/images/chalkpainting.jpg" alt="Pointillism at the Diag">	
		<p>
		Because Hong Kong is a city coined as an "arts desert", she has always hoped to spread the power and appreciation of Arts. Therefore, she is an active Arts Ambassador in campus and has organized different Arts events for students. One of her favorite ones is completing a giant chalk-painting of Georges Seurat's pointillism masterpiece, <i>A Sunday Afternoon on the island of La Grande Jatte</I>, outside of the library.

		<p>
		Since her first road-trip two years ago, she is hoping more to come! Each destination opens up a new lens to the world with its people, custom, and language. One of the most unforgettable places is Antelope in Arizona, US. In seven days, she has traveled to three different states and seen numerous stars in the sky for the first time!
